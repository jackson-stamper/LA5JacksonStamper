/*
Third program - create a program that uses a function to add two numbers from the user and return their sum to the main (calling) program.  
form named ‘calc’
function named ‘Calculate’ that takes two parameters named 'num1' and 'num2' and returns their sum to the main program.
Do NOT use any global variables in the function (only use variables declared in the function and the functin parameters). 
in the main program, gets two numbers from user and send them to the function.
Note: remember to catch the answer that the function returns back to the main program.
in the main program, output answer to console using a template literal in this format:
        The sum of X and Y is Z.
